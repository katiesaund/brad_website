From 2013 to 2020 I served as a mentor for the FIRST robotics team "Error 404: Page Not Found" in Seattle. I have worked with the same group of kids as they progressed from Lego League to FTC.

They have all since graduated high school and gone on to college. The team website is available http://404robotics.com/
