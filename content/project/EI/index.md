At Electroimpact I built robots that build airplanes. As a Controls engineer my primary responsibility was programming the robots, but as an engineer installing these robots in factories around the world I also performed electrical engineering and mechanical design roles when needed. My primary contribution was a calibration method that improved the accuracy of these robots by a factor of 2, allowing these robots to perform tasks previously only possible by larger and more rigid machine tools.
