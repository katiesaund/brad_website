At Carnegie Mellon I used Hebi modules (the red motor-sensor package) to create redundant manipulators (robot arms with more than 6 joints). I wrote planning and control algorithms demonstrating how these skinning, long, snake-like robots can be used for inspection while manufacturing aircraft. Credit to Justus Hibshman for his help with the first video.
